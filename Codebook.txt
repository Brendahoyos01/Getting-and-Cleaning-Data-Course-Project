Feature Selection 
=================

"The features of this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. 
Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. 
Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass 
Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 
The body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived over time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). 
The magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, 
tBodyGyroJerkMag). 
A Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, 
fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 
These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions"

The contraction of raw feature names were changed for more descriptive ones, this is:

t= Time 
f= Frequency
Acc= Accelerometer
std= STD
angle= Angle
Gyro= Gyroscope
Mag= Magnitude
tBody= TimeBody
mean()= Mean
BodyBody= Body
freq()= Frequency
gravity= Gravity

Therefore, the feature names that are showed below were replaced word by word for its decontracted equivalence. For instance, tBodyAccMean was replaced by 
TimeBodyAccelerometerMean. Following you will find the name of the different measurements evaluated for each subject tested filtered by only the STD and Mean values.

Additional vectors obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample. These are used on the Angle() variable:

gravityMean
tBodyAccMean
tBodyAccJerkMean
tBodyGyroMean
tBodyGyroJerkMean


The prefix 't' was used to denote time in the initial features and 'f' frequency as it is shown below: 

tBodyAcc-XYZ
tGravityAcc-XYZ
tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
tBodyGyro-XYZ
tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
tBodyAccMag
tGravityAccMag
tBodyAccJerkMag
tBodyGyroMag
tBodyGyroJerkMag
fBodyAcc-XYZ
fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
fBodyGyro-XYZ
fBodyAccMag
fBodyAccJerkMag
fBodyGyroMag
fBodyGyroJerkMag

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 

Mean(): Mean value
STD(): Standard deviation
